🛡️ TryHackMe Pre‑Security Path — Write‑Up
Overview
The Pre‑Security Path on TryHackMe is designed to build the foundational knowledge required before diving into penetration testing, red teaming, or any advanced cybersecurity discipline.
This write‑up documents my learning journey through the path, breaking down each module with clear explanations and technical insights.

📚 Path Structure
The path consists of four main modules:

Module	Description
Cyber Security Introduction	Core security concepts, threat actors, attack types
Networking Fundamentals	OSI model, TCP/IP, protocols, packet analysis
Linux Fundamentals	Command line basics, permissions, processes
Windows Fundamentals	Registry, services, PowerShell, system internals
🧩 1. Cyber Security Introduction
Key Concepts Learned
Security domains and roles: Red Team, Blue Team, Purple Team

Types of attacks:

Social Engineering

Malware

Web‑based attacks

Core principles:

CIA Triad

Threat Actors

Attack Surface

Technical Highlights
Understanding the attack lifecycle:
Recon → Initial Access → Privilege Escalation → Persistence → Exfiltration

Introduction to MITRE ATT&CK as a framework for adversary techniques

🌐 2. Networking Fundamentals
Core Knowledge
OSI Model (Layer‑by‑Layer understanding)

TCP/IP Model

Essential protocols:

HTTP / HTTPS

DNS

DHCP

ARP

ICMP

Practical Skills
Packet inspection using Wireshark

Understanding ports and services

Network troubleshooting using:

bash
ping
traceroute
netstat
🐧 3. Linux Fundamentals
What I Learned
Navigating the Linux filesystem

Managing files, directories, and permissions

Working with processes

Using package managers

Essential commands:

bash
ls -la
chmod
chown
grep
find
ps aux
Technical Notes
Understanding permission levels (e.g., 777 / 755 / 644)

Working with SUID binaries

Redirection and piping

Basics of Bash scripting

🪟 4. Windows Fundamentals
Core Concepts
Windows Registry structure

Managing services

Using Event Viewer

Understanding processes and threads

PowerShell basics

Useful Commands
powershell
Get-Process
Get-Service
Get-EventLog
Get-LocalUser
🎯 Summary of the Path
Completing the Pre‑Security path strengthened my understanding of:

Networking

Operating systems (Linux & Windows)

Cybersecurity fundamentals

Analytical thinking

How systems work before attempting to exploit them

This foundation is essential for progressing into advanced areas such as:

Penetration Testing

Red Teaming

Web Application Security

Malware Analysis

📝 Personal Notes
Since my primary focus is now Red Teaming, this path was crucial in building the underlying knowledge needed to understand how systems operate before attacking them.
I follow a fixed workflow for every lab:

Review the underlying basics

Do a short focused mini‑training on the lab’s concept

Solve the lab step‑by‑step with full reasoning
