🛡️ TryHackMe — My Cybersecurity Learning Journey
Introduction
TryHackMe has been one of the most important platforms in my cybersecurity journey.
I use it not just to complete rooms, but to build real technical depth, strengthen my fundamentals, and prepare myself for advanced Red Team operations.

This README documents my personal experience, learning style, and the value I gained from the platform.

🚀 Why I Use TryHackMe
For me, TryHackMe is more than a training website — it’s a structured environment where I can:

Build strong fundamentals before attacking systems

Practice real-world offensive techniques safely

Strengthen my Red Team mindset

Train consistently with hands-on labs

Track my progress and measure my growth

I combine TryHackMe with other platforms (like BTLO, GitHub Education, and DataCamp) to create a complete learning ecosystem.

📚 How I Learn on TryHackMe
I follow a fixed workflow for every room or lab:

1️⃣ Start with the underlying basics
Before touching the lab, I review the core concepts behind it:

Networking (DNS, HTTP, ARP, TCP/IP)

Operating systems (Linux processes, Windows registry, services)

Security fundamentals (MITRE, threat actors, attack lifecycle)

Encoding & formats (Base64, JWT, logs, file structures)

2️⃣ Do a focused mini‑training
If the room is about a specific topic (e.g., JWT, DNS, privilege escalation),
I do a short, targeted refresher to ensure I fully understand the concept before applying it.

3️⃣ Solve the lab step‑by‑step
I never rush through tasks.
I break down every step, analyze the output, and understand why each command works.

4️⃣ Document everything
I write detailed notes, explanations, and reasoning — not just answers.
This helps me build long-term knowledge and improves my Red Team thinking.

🧩 What I’ve Completed So Far
I’ve worked through multiple TryHackMe paths and rooms, including:

Pre‑Security (Foundational knowledge)

Networking & OS fundamentals

Linux & Windows basics

Beginner offensive labs

Hands-on challenges that build real attacker skills

This foundation supports my current focus on Red Teaming and offensive security.

🎯 Skills I Developed Through TryHackMe
TryHackMe helped me strengthen key areas:

🔹 Technical Fundamentals
OSI & TCP/IP

DNS, DHCP, ARP, ICMP

Linux permissions, processes, SUID

Windows services, registry, PowerShell

🔹 Offensive Skills
Recon & enumeration

Web exploitation basics

Privilege escalation concepts

Understanding attacker workflows

🔹 Analytical Thinking
Breaking problems into steps

Understanding system behavior

Reading logs and outputs

Building attacker logic

🛠️ Why TryHackMe Works for Me
The platform fits my learning style because it is:

Hands-on — I learn by doing

Structured — paths guide me step-by-step

Beginner-friendly — but still useful for advanced learners

Realistic — labs simulate real attack scenarios

Flexible — I can combine it with my Red Team studies

It’s the perfect place to build a strong base before diving deeper into offensive security.

📈 My Cybersecurity Journey (So Far)
Alongside TryHackMe, I’ve also completed:

9 Google Cybersecurity courses

300+ pages of Cisco CyberOps

IBM Ethical Hacking with Open Source

DataCamp: Intro to APIs in Python & Regular Expressions

GitHub Foundations (currently working toward certification)

One-year TryHackMe subscription

Shifted focus fully toward Red Teaming

TryHackMe is a core part of this journey — especially for building the fundamentals that every Red Teamer needs.

✔️ Conclusion
TryHackMe has played a major role in shaping my cybersecurity foundation.
It helped me build the knowledge I need before moving into advanced Red Team labs and offensive techniques.
